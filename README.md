# Harry Potter Brick Game
Welcome to Hogwarts!

## Why this game?
It's a funny game, and as a huge fan of Harry Potter, I wanted to create something with this universe.

## Key features
There's 4 differents colors for bricks. 
Each one represent a house : Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Griffindor and Slytherin and each one got different points.

## What's next ?
Improve the responsive part. You can play on your phone but have to click where you want the paddle, we can improve that part for the player to be able to slide on the screen to move the paddle.
Store the score to do a "Top10"
